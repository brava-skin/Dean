# Dean - ML-Enhanced Meta Ads Automation

🤖 Dean is a self-learning automation runner for Meta Advantage+ (ASC+) campaigns. It blends deterministic guardrails with a multi-layer ML stack, creative refresh pipeline, Supabase-backed analytics, and Slack-based observability.

## 📦 Repo Layout

- Core implementation lives in [`dean/`](dean/).
- Documentation, setup steps, and feature deep dives are in [`dean/README.md`](dean/README.md).
- Requirements and vendored virtual environment reside alongside the project for reproducible execution.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Unified ML pipeline** with model validation, anomaly detection, creative similarity, and explainable kill/promote/scale logic.
- **Advanced creative automation** using Flux, template libraries, and creative DNA analysis to keep Advantage+ fresh.
- **Supabase data backbone** with strict validation, lifecycle logging, fatigue analytics, and health monitoring.
- **Slack-first operations** for run summaries, decisions, anomalies, and ML learning progress.
- **Resilient infrastructure** featuring retry/backoff, rate-limit management, caching, and self-healing automation loops.

## 🆕 Recent (Nov 2025)

- ASC+ stage handler rewired for five-creative Advantage+ setups with integrated ML overrides.
- ML pipeline hardened with retryable execution, cold-start similarity, and automated validation storage.
- Creative engine upgraded with DNA analysis, variant testing, prompt evolution, and self-healing refresh logic.
- Analytics/monitoring layer expanded to track fatigue velocity, momentum, and Supabase table integrity.
- Infrastructure layer now enforces stricter data validation, transaction safety, and rate-limit protection.
