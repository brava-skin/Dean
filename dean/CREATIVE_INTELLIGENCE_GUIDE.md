### 4. Configuration
The system uses `dean/config/creative_intelligence.yaml` for configuration. Key settings:

- `enabled`: Enable/disable the creative intelligence system
- `ai_generation.enabled`: Enable AI-powered creative generation
- `performance_tracking.enabled`: Enable performance tracking
- `similarity_analysis.enabled`: Enable semantic similarity analysis

## Usage

### Automatic Integration
The Creative Intelligence System is automatically initialized when you run Dean with Supabase enabled. It will:

1. Load your existing copy bank data into Supabase
2. Start tracking creative performance automatically
3. Provide insights and recommendations

### Manual Creative Management

#### Generate AI Creatives
```python
from creative.creative_intelligence import create_creative_intelligence_system

# Initialize the system
creative_system = create_creative_intelligence_system(supabase_client, openai_api_key)

# Generate AI creatives based on a top performer
new_creatives = creative_system.generate_ai_creatives(
    source_creative_id="headline_1",
    creative_type="headline",
    count=3
)
```

#### Analyze Creative Performance
```python
# Get performance insights
insights = creative_system.analyze_creative_performance(days_back=30)

# Get top performing creatives
top_creatives = creative_system.get_top_creatives("headline", limit=10)
```

#### Find Similar Creatives
```python
# Find semantically similar creatives
similar = creative_system.find_similar_creatives("headline_1", threshold=0.7)
```

## Database Tables

### `creative_library`
Stores all creatives (primary texts, headlines, descriptions) with metadata and performance scores.

### `creative_performance`
Tracks performance metrics for each creative used in ads.

### `creative_combinations`
Tracks performance of specific creative combinations (primary text + headline + description).

### `ai_generated_creatives`
Stores AI-generated creatives with generation metadata.

### `creative_similarity`
Stores semantic similarity scores between creatives.

### `creative_patterns`
Stores ML-identified patterns in creative performance.

### `creative_ab_tests`
Manages A/B tests for creative optimization.

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:

- **Engagement Metrics**: CTR, impressions, clicks
- **Conversion Metrics**: ROAS, CPA, purchase rate
- **Creative-Specific Metrics**: Engagement rate, conversion rate
- **Combination Metrics**: Performance of creative combinations

## AI Integration

### ChatGPT Integration
- Generates new creatives based on top performers
- Maintains brand voice and style consistency
- Optimizes for social media advertising best practices

### Semantic Analysis
- Uses sentence-transformers for semantic similarity
- Identifies creative patterns and themes
