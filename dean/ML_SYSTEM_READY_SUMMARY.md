## 🚀 Ready for Real Data Testing

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Standard Mode**: Working perfectly (legacy system)
- ✅ **ML Components**: All ML packages working
- ✅ **XGBoost**: Fixed and operational
- ⚠️ **ML Mode**: Needs Supabase credentials to test

### **To Test with Real Data:**

#### Step 1: Set Up Credentials
Create a `.env` file with:
```bash
# Meta API Credentials
FB_APP_ID=your-app-id
FB_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
FB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
FB_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
FB_PIXEL_ID=your-pixel-id
FB_PAGE_ID=your-page-id
STORE_URL=your-store-url
IG_ACTOR_ID=your-instagram-actor-id

# Supabase Credentials (for ML mode)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

#### Step 2: Test Standard Mode
```bash
# This should work exactly like before
python3 src/main.py --dry-run
```

#### Step 3: Test ML Mode
```bash
# This should show ML enhancements
python3 src/main.py --ml-mode --dry-run
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Standard Mode (Legacy System):**
- Same ad loading behavior
- Same rule application  
- Same output format
- No breaking changes

### **ML Mode (New System):**
