# ML System Real Data Testing Guide

## 🧪 Testing the ML System with Real Meta Ads Data

This guide will help you test the ML-enhanced Dean system with real data to validate it can replace the old system.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### 1. Meta API Credentials
You need the following environment variables set in a `.env` file:

```bash
# Meta API Credentials
FB_APP_ID=your-app-id
FB_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
FB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
FB_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
FB_PIXEL_ID=your-pixel-id
FB_PAGE_ID=your-page-id
STORE_URL=your-store-url
IG_ACTOR_ID=your-instagram-actor-id

# Supabase Credentials (for ML mode)
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 2. Database Setup
- Supabase database with ML schema deployed
- Security fixes applied

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Standard Mode (Legacy System)
```bash
# Test the old system still works
python3 src/main.py --dry-run

# Expected: Should work exactly like before
# - Loads ads from Meta API
# - Applies existing rules
# - Shows same output format
```

### Test 2: ML-Enhanced Mode (New System)
```bash
# Test the new ML system
python3 src/main.py --ml-mode --dry-run

# Expected: Should show ML enhancements
# - ML intelligence analysis
# - Adaptive rules adjustments
# - Predictive insights
# - Cross-stage learning
```

### Test 3: ML Mode with Real Data
```bash
# Test ML system with actual Meta data
python3 src/main.py --ml-mode --stage testing --dry-run

# Expected: Should analyze real ad performance
# - Extract features from real ads
# - Train ML models on real data
# - Make predictions based on real patterns
```
